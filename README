* UPDATE *
- Releasing Intersect 2.0 publicly on git tomorrow morning.
- Full source code will be available and all other features, additions, and otherwise will be updated here.



Background
----------

Intersect 2.0 is an application written to perform automated Post-Exploitation information gathering and reporting.
The general idea is that after you have exploited a target, you run this script and it performs a variety of tasks
that you would normally need to perform manually. Intersect will collect password files, copy SSH keys, enumerate 
processes and installed applications, gather detailed network information, map the hosts internal network (for pivoting),
locate and identify common anti-virus and firewall applications and much more.

The original version of Intersect was a private script and did not have nearly as many features as this version.
One of the big advantages of this version is the capability to find live hosts on the exploited network and enumerate
services that can be used to pivot access to other systems. Also, I added the ability to transfer the final reports and
files to a remote system of your choosing. This can be done by using an SFTP transfer or HTTP tunnel. This version can
also scan the system for common anti-virus, firewalls, IDS/IPS and many other applications. 
You will be notified of which applications are installed and where they are located.

As of right now, Intersect 2.0 is being released in the form of a private beta.
You can request to be part of this beta by emailing bindshell@live.com with the subject "Intersect Beta." 
The beta edition is not a full-featured release. It still has most of the features and techniques but 
the Full Edition uses different methods and approaches to find the information. I will be releasing the Full Edition
after the New Year. edition will be available to the general public and will include all the features I've talked about,
plus a few extra goodies. In the Features section I have posted two separate Read-Me files that explain the differences
between the two releases.
