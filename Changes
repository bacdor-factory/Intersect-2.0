Added: Semi-interactive TCP bind shell. The shell binds to the server port 443 and accepts connects via netcat.
You can read files, make/delete folders, add user accounts, view processes, netstat, etc.
I am soon adding a new custom shell that will bind over SSL and you will have a wide variety of features, such as live sniffing
and the capability of running Intersect commands over the shell and installing add-on modules.
