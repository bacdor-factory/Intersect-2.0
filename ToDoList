Intersect 2.0 To-Do List
[x] marks completed task.


* Fix exploitCheck() feature and non-root permission issues
* Implement port-scanning after live-hosts are found
* Identify services by port number via socket
* Rewrite software fingerprints and locatons for getProtection() feature
* SNMP Scanner/Enum

* Fix the getGateway process. Right now, we assume you are using 192.168.1.0/24. New process will pull the gateway
  from ifconfig using your local IP, drop the last octet and add .0/24 to grab your gateway.
* Add process that dumps the plain-text from memory and sends to .txt file
=======
* Find suid files
[x] Add scrubme.py code as an option (hides your user presence from other users in 'who' 'w' 'last' and 'lastlog' commands)
* Add bindshell listener as option (example: './Intersect.py --bind' opens SSL bindshell)
* Fix the getGateway process. Right now, we assume you are using 192.168.1.0/24. New process will pull the gateway
  from ifconfig using your local IP, drop the last octet and add .0/24 to grab your gateway.
* Add process that dumps the plain-text from memory and sends to .txt file
* Write custom client to interact with --bind listener
* Optionally send NetworkMap() output to be imported within Metasploit DB
