Intersect 2.0 To-Do List


* SSH/SFTP Support for transfering report.tar.gz to a remote host
* Fix exploitCheck() feature and non-root permission issues
* Implement port-scanning after live-hosts are found
* Identify services by port number via socket
* Rewrite software fingerprints and locatons for getProtection() feature
* SNMP Scanner/Enum
* Create traceroute graph for NetworkMap()
* Fix Temp_Dir creation process
* Find suid files
* Add scrubme.py code as an option (hides your user presence from other users in 'who' 'w' 'last' and 'lastlog' commands)
* Add bindshell listener as option (example: './Intersect.py --listen 4441 creates interactive shell on port 4441)
* Fix the getGateway process. Right now, we assume you are using 192.168.1.0/24. New process will pull the gateway
  from ifconfig using your local IP, drop the last octet and add .0/24 to grab your gateway.
* Add process that dumps the plain-text from memory and sends to .txt file
* *Maybe* add a tcp sniffing feature that the user can run as a background process and saves dump file for later retrieval
*
