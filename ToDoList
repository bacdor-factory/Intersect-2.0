Intersect 2.0 To-Do List


* SSH/SFTP Support for transfering report.tar.gz to a remote host
* Fix exploitCheck() feature and non-root permission issues
* Implement port-scanning after live-hosts are found
* Identify services by port number via socket
* Rewrite software fingerprints and locatons for getProtection() feature
* SNMP Scanner/Enum
* Create traceroute graph for NetworkMap()
* Fix Temp_Dir creation process
* Fix the getGateway process. Right now, we assume you are using 192.168.1.0/24. New process will pull the gateway
  from ifconfig using your local IP, drop the last octet and add .0/24 to grab your gateway.
* Add process that dumps the plain-text from memory and sends to .txt file
